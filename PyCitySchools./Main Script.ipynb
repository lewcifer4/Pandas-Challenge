    "As a whole, schools that had higher budgets, did not produce better test results as might be expected. On the contrary, schools with higher spending per student (645-675 dollars) underperformed compared to schools that had a smaller budget (585 dollars per student).\n",

    "A majority of the time, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more in-depth analysis would be required to investigate if that was due to the methods of teaching of the school itself or the fact that charter schools on average serve have a smaller pool of students, and therefore they can get more focused teaching compared to a school that has a large population of students.\n",
